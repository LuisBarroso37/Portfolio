# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio showcasing some of the projects I have developed so far.

Making this portfolio has been the hardest project I have made in terms of creating a webpage. I have integrated some sections that I got from the course "Build and deploy a portfolio on DigitalOcean" in Scrimba. Overall I am quite happy the end result.

This page is built using plain HTML and CSS. 
In order to make the page responsive I have added Bootstrap in a later stage.
